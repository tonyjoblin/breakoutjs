MDN Breakout Game tutorial

Initially I started doing this with my son. I remember building one of these when I was a kid. Back then I wrote it in basic on an Amstrad 64. So that was kind of a cool moment.

I used this to learn a bit about testing with jasmine + karma. The tests ran really fast. After I saved a file with Ctrl+S and Alt+tab to the console running the tests they were done. This was much faster than running tests in some of the C++ or C# environments I have used in the past. To be fair the code base here is tiny.

The code is a mess. I am not planning to take the project any further. I am probably not going to get much more out of this by continuing to polish it. Maybe if my kid gets interested in coding I can come back to it.

Done.
